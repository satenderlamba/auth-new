              DEC, the brainchild of ECell NSUT, offers the ground for
              likeminded enthusiasts to indulge in regular skill enhancing
              activities including group discussions, case studies, etc. to
              elucidate the dislimn of horrors of commencing something different
              and ingenious. We believe that entrepreneurship isn't convoluted,
              the only stipulation is to embark on the expedition along with
              adherence, hard work, devotion and insight to get the desired
              output.

            DEC has a total of 25 tasks that the teams would have to perform in
            their colleges, and online, whatever suits them best. Each task
            would have some points related to it, and proper submission would
            make the team eligible for those points. Also, certain tasks would
            require an on-campus round, and therefore, they must be performed
            accordingly. Each event will contain a description, the submission
            pattern, and the point system. At the end, total point would be
            calculated according to the submissions. Top 8 performing teams
            would battle it out during the final on campus round during The
            Entrepreneurship Summit 2019.
